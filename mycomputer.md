## Commentary 
### My Relationship To My Computer 
I bought this specific computer the day before my first day of sophmore year. I was using my previous computer which was a Macbook Air, and it started overheating and creating very loud alarm noises. This wasn't the first time that happened and I decided that it was the perfect time to let go of my slow, probably virus infested, broken, 5 year old computer. I had been looking at this specific model of the new Macbook pro in the space grey color with the touchbar and I finally bought it. I love my laptop, I love how it looks and how it functions, it's extremely fast and has not causes me any major problems in the past 2 years that i've had it. 
### Hardware Configuration 
1. The biggest issue that happens with my Mac is `overheating`. When I'm using my mac continously for a long period of time and many tabs are open, it begins to overheat. This caused by the fact that my CPU is overleaded with resource-intensive tasks at that given moment in time. You can reduce the load that's put on CPU by adding more RAM which means you can store more data on your computer. 
2. Another issue that happens with my computer that is directed to bad RAM is that it has `trouble waking up from sleep` sometimes. This might be the cause of a faulty RAM module and can be fixed by running the Apple Hardware Test. 
3. Another problem that is rare for me is `losing audio`, which can be blamed on a problem with the logic board or motherboard.
